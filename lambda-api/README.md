# thisPlace API

The purpose of this function is to call any third parties the front end needs

The function is triggered by an api gateway

## Usage:
### NPM Commands
- `npm run create` creates the function for the first time on AWS Lambda with the version set to `dev`
- `npm run deploy` updates any changes to the existing function
- `npm run test` runs a test on the function with the data in `event.json` as the input
- `npm run logs` fetches the logs from AWS CloudWatch. **Note** that logs might not get generated directly after running the lambda function, in that case it's easier to check the logs on the AWS Console
- `npm run smart-deploy` deploys, tests then fetches the log
- `npm run recreate` destroys and recreates the function
- `npm run smart-recreate` same as `recreate` but it also tests the function and then fetches the log
