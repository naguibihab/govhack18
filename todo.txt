Todo:
+ Map
   > Get user location automatically & show a pin
   + Searchable (Nice to have)
+ Call Canadian map API to get the name of the region
+ Query our own database (Need to get this data) with that API and get the text for it
   + Get data and store it somewhere (Maybe its own API)
   + Query the data english version
   + Give the user the ability to switch languages (John already worked on this so keep it last)
+ Call Wikipedia to get more data about it (Nice to have, ask Jeremy how can I do this?)
